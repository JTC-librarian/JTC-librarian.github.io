      <h3>Odysseus’ Entrance at Sophocles' <i>Philoctetes</i> 974</h3>
      <p class="citation">Clark, James. 2023. Odysseus’ Entrance at Sophocles' <i>Philoctetes</i> 974. <i>Acta Classica</i> 66, pp. 176-185.</p>
      <p class="abstract">Early references in <i>Philoctetes</i> to the cave's two mouths are cited as evidence that Philoctetes entered from the cave at 219—it is said that Sophocles inserted them to inform the audience that there is an off-stage mouth. This note suggests that the only other mention of the two mouths, just before Odysseus' entrance at 974, is intended to remind the audience of the off-stage mouth so that it is comprehensible when Odysseus enters from the cave. This is speculative, but the coincidence of collocation that must otherwise be assumed should not be underestimated.</p>

      <p class="abstract">Characters are directly summoned from an elite house far less frequently than from a humble dwelling; Phoenissae is the exception, and this serves to emphasize its themes and aspects of its characters.</p>

      <h3>Extrametrical NAI and EIEN in Greek Tragedy</h3>
      <p class="citation">Clark, James T. 2022. Extrametrical NAI and EIEN in Greek Tragedy. <i>Classical Philology</i> 117(2), pp. 399-410.</p>
      <p class="abstract">This note examines all extra-metrical occurrences of the phatic interjections ναί and εἶἑν in Greek tragedy. It first establishes that it is likely that extra-metrical interjections were followed by a pause in delivery, that it is unusual for phatic interjections to be separated from the discourse in this way, and that the tragedians probably had some particular effect in mind when placing these words extra metrum. The ten passages are then examined in turn, and interpretations of the significance of the pauses are offered.</p>

      <h3>Off-Stage Cries?</h3>

      <p class="abstract">There are three instances of off-stage cries that have no cries transcribed in our manuscripts: Sophocles’ Philoctetes 201–218, Trachiniae 863–870, and Euripides’ Electra 747–760. These three are also the only cries where the on-stage characters express doubt about whether they can hear the cries. This pattern is unlikely to occur by chance, and instead seems very likely to tell us something about how the passages were performed, probably that the cries were not sounded at all.</p>

      <h3>Penthemimeral Elision in Tragic Trimiters</h3>
      <p class="citation">Clark, James T. 2021. Penthemimeral Elision in Tragic Trimiters. <i>Philologus</i> 165(2), pp. 189-204.</p>
      <p class="abstract">This paper provides a statistical survey of the incidence of elision at the penthemimeral caesura in the iambic trimeters of Greek tragedy. It updates and builds on the work of Descroix (1931) by considering the rates of elision of different types of words: lexicals, nonlexical polysyllables, and nonlexical monosyllables. While all tragedians elide less at the caesura than throughout the line, in Aeschylus the rate of this reduction is far greater for lexicals and polysyllabic nonlexicals than it is for monosyllabic nonlexicals. On this evidence, and the evidence of interlinear elision, it is tentatively suggested that lexicals and nonlexical polysyllables should together be considered as the more constrained elisions. When the rates of constrained elision are examined, the difference between Aeschylus and later Euripides is revealed to be twice that obtained when bulk figures are used. This difference is attributed to a combination of Euripides’ adoption of more fluent phrasing towards the end of his career and the tragedians’ different approaches to compositional constraints.</p>

      <h3>Reported Speech in Greek Tragedy</h3>
      <p class="citation">Clark, James T. 2020. Reported Speech in Greek Tragedy. <i>Illinois Classical Studies</i> 45(1), pp. 1-24.</p>
      <p class="abstract">This article examines reported direct speech embedded in narrative sections of Greek tragedy, analyzing the content of reported speeches, their metrical form, and the descriptions of their sound. Reported direct speech is revealed to be considerably restrained, even when it occurs in highly emotional contexts. This restraint is interesting, given the prevalence of non-linguistic cries in tragedy, and it is brought into particular relief by comparison with the descriptions of violent utterances that often precede or follow sections of direct speech. There is a discernible, though inconsistent, trend towards the loosening of this restraint in later Euripides.</p>

      <h3>The Skene Door in the Prologue of Sophocles’ <i>Ajax</i></h3>
      <p class="citation">Clark, James T. 2019. The Skene Door in the Prologue of Sophocles’ <i>Ajax</i>. <i>Mnemosyne</i> 72(5), pp. 861-866.</p>
      <p class="abstract">At the start of Sophocles' Ajax Odysseus looks through the skene door. A little later, we hear that Tecmessa has seen through the skene door from within the skene, as she describes seeing Ajax outside. These are probably the only two instances in extant tragedy of a character looking through the skene doorway (when it represents an actual door). This visual motif links with themes of sight that Sophocles introduces to this tragedy.</p>
